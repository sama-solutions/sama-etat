# Senegal Government Project Management Odoo Module

This Odoo 18 Community Edition module is designed to manage government projects, decisions, events, and budgets, with a strategic alignment to the Plan Sénégal 2050.

## Features

-   **Strategic Planning:** Manage the Plan Sénégal 2050, including its Pillars, Axes, and Strategic Objectives.
-   **Government Operations:** Track and manage government projects, official decisions, public events, and investment/operational budgets.
-   **Interlinking:** Dynamically link business objects (projects, decisions, events, budgets) to specific strategic objectives.
-   **User Interface:** Provides tree, form, and kanban views (kanban to be implemented) with filtering capabilities.
-   **Security:** Role-based access control for planners, administrators, general users, and public access.

## Installation (for Dockerized Odoo)

Follow these steps to install or update the module in your Dockerized Odoo environment:

1.  **Copy the Module to Odoo Addons Path:**

    First, ensure your Odoo container is running. You need to copy the `senegal_gov_project_management` directory into your Odoo container's addons path. Replace `[YOUR_ODOO_CONTAINER_NAME]` with the actual name of your Odoo container (e.g., `odoo_instance` if you know it, or find it using `docker ps`).

    ```bash
    docker cp senegal_gov_project_management [YOUR_ODOO_CONTAINER_NAME]:/opt/odoo/addons/senegal_gov_project_management
    ```

    *If you are unsure of your Odoo container name, run `docker ps` to list running containers and identify it.* 

2.  **Restart the Odoo Container:**

    It's crucial to restart the Odoo container to ensure all Python code changes are reloaded.

    ```bash
    docker restart [YOUR_ODOO_CONTAINER_NAME]
    ```

3.  **Update Odoo Apps List & Install/Upgrade Module:**

    Once the container has restarted, you have two options:

    *   **Via Odoo Web Interface:**
        1.  Log in to your Odoo instance as an administrator.
        2.  Go to `Apps`.
        3.  Click on `Update Apps List` (you might need to remove the `Apps` filter to see this option).
        4.  Search for "Senegal Government Project Management".
        5.  Click `Install` (if it's a new installation) or `Upgrade` (if you are updating an existing module).

    *   **Via Docker Exec (Command Line - Recommended for updates):**
        This method is often more reliable for updates as it forces a module refresh.

        ```bash
        docker exec [YOUR_ODOO_CONTAINER_NAME] odoo --addons-path=/opt/odoo/addons -d [YOUR_DATABASE_NAME] -u senegal_gov_project_management --stop-after-init
        ```
        Replace `[YOUR_DATABASE_NAME]` with the name of your Odoo database.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or usage, the most important step is to check the Odoo server logs. You can view the logs of your Odoo container using:

```bash
docker logs [YOUR_ODOO_CONTAINER_NAME]
```

Look for Python tracebacks or error messages that provide more details about the problem. If you need further assistance, provide these logs.

## Further Development

This module provides a strong foundation. Future enhancements could include:

-   Implementing Kanban views for relevant models.
-   Adding advanced filters and search capabilities.
-   Developing graph views for budget vs. objective analysis.
-   Refining security rules, especially for `gov_user` based on ministry.
-   Implementing the `strategic.kpi` model.
-   Creating a dedicated `government.ministry` model.
